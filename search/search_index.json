Backup file path To identify backup files and to avoid collision, Priam organizes the files in S3 by including time, keyspace name, token, date, DC/region and cluster name. Here is the general format: App Prefix / Region or DC / Cluster name / Token / Date Time / File type / Keyspace / FileName Here are valid file types (refer AbstractBackupPath.BackupFileType ): SNAP - Snapshot file META - Meta file for all snapshot files SST - Incremental SSTable file Here is a sample snapshot file in S3: test_backup/eu-west-1/cass_test/37809151880104273718152734159458104939/201202142346/SNAP/MyKeyspace/MyCF-g-265-Data.db Multipart upload Priam leverages the multipart upload feature of S3. This helps in uploading large files in parallel. Each file is chunked into several parts and each part is uploaded in parallel. Compression Priam uses snappy compression to compress data files. Each file is chunked and compressed on the fly. Throttling Throttling of uploads helps reduce disk IO and network IO as well. With Priam properties, you can set the Mb/s which are read from the disk. SNS Notifications Priam can send SNS Notifications, pre and post upload of any file to S3. This allows a cleaner integration with external service depending on backups which are about to be uploaded. Async Uploads Priam allows user to configure if they wish to do parallel uploads to remote file system for snapshots and incrementals. Doing parallel uploads makes your backup faster but may use the bandwidth of the instance and thus starve Cassandra. Bandwidth used by backups can be controlled by throttling them. This should be carefully reviewed based on your instance capabilities. Priam by default does NOT allow async uploads, though our suggestion is to enable them on few instances and see the performance and then tune. In our internal testing, we have hardly found Cassandra to be starved by bandwidth usage (even during peak). Configuration priam.s3.bucket : This is the default S3 location where all backup files will be uploaded to. E.g. s3_bucket_region . Default: cassandra-archive priam.upload.throttle : This allows backup/incremental's to be throttled so they don't end up taking all the bandwidth from Cassandra. Note: try to schedule full snapshot during off-peak time. Tweak this only if required else your snapshot would starve. Default: MAX_INT_VALUE . priam.backup.notification.topic.arn : Amazon Resource Name for the SNS service where notifications need to be sent. This assumes that all the topics are created and the instance has permission to send SNS messages. Disabled if the value is null or empty. Default: None . priam.backup.chunksizemb : Size of the file in MB above which Priam will try to use multi-part uploads. Note that chunk size of the file being uploaded is as defined by user only if total parts to be uploaded (based on file size) will not exceed 10000 (max limit from AWS). If file is bigger than 10000 * configured chunk size, Priam will adjust the chunk size to ensure it can upload the file. Default: 10 MB priam.backup.queue.size : Queue size to be used for backup uploads. Note that once queue is full, we would wait for priam.upload.timeout to add any new item before declining the request and throwing exception. Default: 100,000. priam.backup.threads : The number of backup threads to be used to upload files to S3. Default: 2 priam.upload.timeout : Uploads are scheduled in priam.backup.queue.size . If queue is full then we wait for this time for the queue to have an entry available for queueing the current task. Default: 2 minutes. Snapshot or complete backup Priam leverages Cassandra's snapshot feature to have an eventually consistent backup. Cassandra's snapshot feature flushes data to disk and hard links all SSTable files into a snapshot directory. These files are then picked up by Priam and uploaded to S3. Although snapshotting across the cluster is not guaranteed to produce a consistent backup of the cluster, consistency is resumed upon restore by Cassandra and running repairs. Priam uses Quartz to schedule all tasks. Snapshot backups are run as a recurring task. They can also be triggered via REST API (refer API section), which is useful during upgrades or maintenance operations. Snapshots are run on a CRON for the entire cluster, at a specific time, ideally during non-peak hours. Priam's backup.hour or backup.cron property allows you to set daily snapshot time (refer properties). The snapshot backup orchestrates invoking of Cassandra snapshot JMX command, uploading files to S3 and cleaning up the directory. meta.json All SSTable files are uploaded individually to S3 with built-in retries on failure. Upon completion, the meta file ( meta.json ) is uploaded which contains a reference to all files that belong to the snapshot. This is then used for validation during restore. Backup Status Management Priam by default stores the status of all the snapshot. This is useful to determine if the snapshot at a given Instant was successful. It has support to store status of multiple snapshots for a given date. The default binding is to store these details to a local file configured via priam.backup.status.location . Validation of Snapshot Priam can download the meta.json for a given snapshot, parse it and then validate the backup by ensuring that all the files listed in file are available on remote file system. This can be used to verify that no file was missed during snapshot. Snapshot Configuration priam.backup.schedule.type : This allows you to choose between 2 supported schedule types (CRON or HOUR) for backup. The default value is HOUR . CRON : This allows backup to run on CRON and it expects a valid value of priam.backup.cron to be there. If not, priam will not start and fail fast. Deprecated : HOUR : This allows backup to run on a daily basis at a given hour. It expects a valid value of priam.backup.hour to be there. If not, priam will not start and fail fast. Deprecated : priam.backup.hour : This allows backup to run on a daily basis at a given hour. If the value is -1 , it means snapshot backups and incremental are disabled. Default value: 12 priam.backup.cron : This allows backups to be run on CRON. Example: you want to run a backup once a week. Value needs to be a valid CRON expression. To disable backup, use the value of -1 . The default value is to backup at 12 . priam.snapshot.cf.include : Column Family(ies), comma delimited, to include for snapshot. If no override exists, all keyspaces/cf's will be backed up to remote file system. The expected format is keyspace.cfname. CF name allows special character \" * \" to denote all the columnfamilies in a given keyspace. e.g. keyspace1.* denotes all the CFs in keyspace1. Snapshot exclude list is applied first to exclude CF/keyspace and then snapshot include list is applied to include the CF's/keyspaces. Default: None priam.snapshot.cf.exclude : Column Family(ies), comma delimited, to ignore while doing snapshot. The expected format is keyspace.cfname. CF name allows special character \" * \" to denote all the columnfamilies in a given keyspace. e.g. keyspace1.* denotes all the CFs in keyspace1. Snapshot exclude list is applied first to exclude CF/keyspace and then snapshot include list is applied to include the CF's/keyspaces. Default: None priam.backup.status.location : The absolute path to store the backup status on disk. Default: data file location /backup.status . priam.async.snapshot : This decides if snapshot files should be uploaded to the remote file system in async fashion. This will allow snapshot to use the priam.backup.threads to do parallel uploads. Default: false . API Execute Snapshot http://localhost:8080/Priam/REST/v1/backup/do_snapshot This executes a one time snapshot on this instance and starts uploading the files to remote file system. Output: { ok } ``` ### Backup Status ```http://localhost: 8080 /Priam/REST/v 1 /backup/status``` Get the status of the last known backup. If priam is restarted, it will always show `DONE`. **Output:** ```json { SnapshotStatus : [DONE|ERROR|RUNNING|NOT_APPLICABLE] } Backup Status for a date http://localhost:8080/Priam/REST/v1/backup/status/{date} Determines the status of a snapshot for a date. If there was at least one successful snapshot for the date, snapshot for the date is considered completed. Parameters: * {date}: Required: Date of the snapshot to check in the format of yyyyMMdd . Output: For success: { Snapshotstatus : true , token : token_value , starttime : [yyyyMMddHHmm] , completetime : [yyyyMMddHHmm] } For failure: { Snapshotstatus : true , token : token_value } List all snapshots http://localhost:8080/Priam/REST/v1/backup/status/{date}/snapshots List all the snapshot executed for a date. Parameters: * {date}: Required: Date of the snapshot to check in the format of yyyyMMdd . Output: { Snapshots :[ yyyyMMddHHmm , yyyyMMddHHmm ]} Validate snapshot http://localhost:8080/Priam/REST/v1/backup/validate/snapshot/{daterange} Determines the validity of the backup by Downloading meta.json file Listing of the backup directory Find the missing or extra files in backup location. This by default takes the latest snapshot of the application. One can provide exact hour and min to check specific backup. Note : This is an expensive call (money and time) as it calls list on the remote file system, thus should be used with caution. Parameters: * daterange : Optional: This is a comma separated start time and end time for the snapshot in the format of yyyyMMddHHmm or yyyyMMdd . If no value is provided or a value of default is provided then it takes start time as (current time - 1 day) and end time as current time. Output: { inputStartDate : [yyyyMMddHHmm] , inputEndDate : [yyyyMMddHHmm] , snapshotAvailable : true , valid : true , backupFileListAvailable : true , metaFileFound : true , selectedDate : [yyyyMMdd] , snapshotTime : [yyyyMMddHHmm] , filesInMetaOnly :[ ], filesInS3Only :[ file1 ], filesMatched :[ file1 , file2 ] } List the backup files http://localhost:8080/Priam/REST/v1/backup/list/{daterange} List all the files in the remote file system for the given daterange. Note : This is an expensive call (money and time) as it calls list on the remote file system, thus should be used with caution. Parameters: * daterange : Optional: This is a comma separated start time and end time for the snapshot in the format of yyyyMMddHHmm or yyyyMMdd . If no value is provided or a value of default is provided then it takes start time as (current time - 1 day) and end time as current time. Output: { files : [ { bucket : remote_file_system , filename : file , app : app_name , region : region , token : token , ts : [yyyyMMddHHmm] , instance_id : instance_id , uploaded_ts : [yyyyMMddHHmm] } ], num_files : no_of_files } Incremental backup When incremental backups are enabled in Cassandra, hard links are created for all new SSTables created in the incremental backup directory. Since SSTables are immutable files they can be safely copied to an external source. Priam scans this directory frequently for incremental SSTable files and uploads to S3. Incremental Configuration priam.backup.incremental.enable : This allows the incremental backups to be uploaded to S3. By default every 10 seconds, Priam will try to upload any new files flushed/compacted by Cassandra to disk. Default: true priam.incremental.cf.include : Column Family(ies), comma delimited, to include for incremental backups. If no override exists, all keyspaces/cf's will be backed up to remote file system. The expected format is keyspace.cfname. CF name allows special character \" * \" to denote all the columnfamilies in a given keyspace. e.g. keyspace1.* denotes all the CFs in keyspace1. Incremental exclude list is applied first to exclude CF/keyspace and then incremental include list is applied to include the CF's/keyspaces. Default: None priam.incremental.cf.exclude : Column Family(ies), comma delimited, to ignore while doing incremental backup. The expected format is keyspace.cfname. CF name allows special character \" * \" to denote all the columnfamilies in a given keyspace. e.g. keyspace1.* denotes all the CFs in keyspace1. Incremental exclude list is applied first to exclude CF/keyspace and then incremental include list is applied to include the CF's/keyspaces. Default: None priam.async.incremental : Allow upload of incremental's in parallel using multiple threads. Note that this will take more bandwidth of your cluster and thus should be used with caution. It may be required when you do repair your instance primary token range using subrange repair creating a lot of small files during the process. Default: false API http://localhost:8080/Priam/REST/v1/backup/incremental_backup Enable the incremental backup on this instance. Note : This call does not change the value of the property priam.backup.incremental.enable Output: { ok } Commit log Configuration priam.clbackup.enabled : This allows the backup of the commit logs from Cassandra to the backup location. The default value to check for new commit log is 1 min. Default: false Encryption of Backup/Restore Backups can be encrypted by Priam. Priam can also restore from the encrypted backups for disaster recovery. Note that encryption/decryption is generally CPU and time-intensive process. While uploading the file, it would be first compressed and then encrypted. The reverse of that happens when downloading the file i.e. decrypt and then decompress. Priam uses PGP as the encryption / decryption cryptography algorithm. Other algorithm can be implemented via interface IFileCryptography. *Note: Pgp uses a passphrase to encrypt your private key on your node. See (http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/), section \u201cwhat is a passphrase\u201d for details. Configuration priam.encrypted.backup.enabled : Allow encryption while uploading of the snapshot, incremental and commit logs. Default: false priam.pgp.password.phrase : The passphrase used by the cryptography algorithm to encrypt/decrypt. By default, it is expected that this value will be encrypted using open encrypt.

You can use these or choose to create your own. Build the code Set up your auto-scale group (ASG) and spin up instances Install Cassandra and web container (such as tomcat) on your instances. Setup aws credentials and SimpleDB properties Create S3 buckets to store your backups Copy priam-cass-extensions- .jar into your $CASS_HOME/lib directory Add -javaagent: $CASS_HOME/lib/priam-cass-extensions- version .jar to cassandra's JVM arguments Configure basic configurations Deploy Priam.war in your container Build Process Checkout the code from git and run: /gradlew build The gradlew script will pull down all necessary gradle components/infrastructure automatically, then run the build. This should create both a jar and a war file for your project. Note that, the default provided log4j.properties assumes tomcat deployment. Modify this according to your needs. Priam uses Google Guice. You can override several of the default implementations and bind your implementations in the provided Guice module (see PriamGuiceModule.java) Auto Scaling Group setup When setting up ASG, using as-create-auto-scaling-group, set availability zone to single zone (--availability-zones). For high availability, set multiple ASGs with one zone per ASG. Choosing ASG name Your Cassandra cluster could be spanning multiple ASGs. Such cases arise when you want to provide HA across zones and to overcome the AWS limitation of load balancing across zones i.e., currently, AWS does not guarantee instances will be balanced across zones if instances are not available in a particular zone. In such cases, you could create multiple ASGs with each ASG bound to single zone. In such cases your ASG name should be suffixed with '-{ZONE}' . Eg: test_cluster-useast1a. Web Container setup Since Priam changes the configuration files for Cassandra and starts/stops the services, the web container it's running in must have execute rights on the script to modify the cassandra.yaml file and execute the /etc/init.d/cassandra (configurable location) script. Credentials The default implementation uses clear text credentials. To use this provide AWS accessid and secrectkey in -/etc/awscredential.properties -- copy and modify from src/main/resources/conf/awscredential.properties . You can however, override ICredential to provide a more secure way of obtaining credentials. Additionally, ensure your keys do not contain special characters and are not enclosed in quotes of any kind. The preferred way is to use IAM key profile management. IAMCredential Using IAM Credentials allows you to provide access to the AWS api without storing an AccessKeyId or SecretAccessKey anywhere on the machine. Create a new IAM Role in the AWS console or using the API and make sure it can access EC2, S3, and SimpleDB resources. Assign that role to the auto scaling group. Modify priam/src/main/java/com/netflix/priam/defaultimpl/PriamGuiceModule.java // Add this line import com.netflix.priam.aws.IAMCredential ; public class PriamGuiceModule extends AbstractModule { bind ( IBackupFileSystem . class ). annotatedWith ( Names . named ( backup )). to ( S3FileSystem . class ); bind ( IBackupFileSystem . class ). annotatedWith ( Names . named ( incr_restore )). to ( S3FileSystem . class ); bind ( IBackupFileSystem . class ). annotatedWith ( Names . named ( backup_status )). to ( S3FileSystem . class ); ..... // Add this line bind ( ICredential . class ). to ( IAMCredential . class ); } S3 Buckets Create an S3 bucket to store your backup files. The default bucket name used by PriamConfiguration is cassandra-archive. Ensure the Credentials used above has permissions to read/write to this S3 bucket. For best performance (and cost), consider creating one S3 bucket per AWS region. SimpleDB Domains Priam uses SimpleDB to register nodes as well as read properties. Create the following SimpleDB domains: InstanceIdentity PriamProperties. Use PriamProperties to add properties if you want to modify defaults. InstanceIdentity is used by Priam to register nodes. The SimpleDB domains must be located in the US-East-1 region. Note : SimpleDB Configuration Management and Token Management is soon to be deprecated and moved to use DynamoDB. PriamStartupAgent and NFSeedProvider These are the 2 classes that will be required by Cassandra for starting and fetching token, seeds and other information from Priam. You will need to copy priam-cass-extensions- .jar into your $CASS_HOME/lib directory, and add -javaagent:$CASS_HOME/lib/priam-cass-extensions- .jar to cassandra's JVM arguments. Priam updates cassandra.yaml with NFSeedProvider by default. Configuration To change the default Priam properties, you can create property items in the PriamProperties SimpleDB domain. Each property item is defined by the attributes appId, property and value. appId is set to the ASG name by default. When using multiple ASGs, the zone suffix is removed. Refer above for ASG naming convention. Refer to Properties for property name and default value for all property items. Providing start and stop scripts Configure the name of the application. As part of the configuration provide any custom start and stop scripts to Priam via properties. PriamConfiguration defaults to /etc/init.d/cassandra script for starting and stopping. Deploying Copy the jar generated in the build step into the cassandra lib directory. Deploy the war into your web container. Verification To see if Priam has started successfully, you can lookup SimpleDB InstanceIdentity domain for entries for the ASG. Each entry will have instanceid, hostname, token and other details used by the particular node. You can also verify REST API by running: curl http://localhost:8080/Priam/REST/v1/cassconfig/get_token This should return the token used by node. Kudos if you reached so far!

To restore a cluster, the user specifies a start and end time for which the backup data is available. Priam executes the following sequence of steps for restoring: Search for the latest snapshot within the time range Download meta file for the snapshot Download snapshot files specified in the meta file Download all available incremental files up to the end time Execute a post restore hook if available, and wait for completion of the hook execution Start the cluster and join the ring The LocationInfo files are ignored and not backed up. This forces Cassandra to rediscover other nodes in the cluster upon restore and refresh the ring nodes. Important : Restores should only be performed on the same size cluster. Async Downloads During restore, the instance is not in service and thus Priam tries its best to utilize available bandwidth to download the SSTables from remote file system. We use 8 threads by default to download the files. Configuration priam.restore.prefix : This is the location from where the backup will be restored. This has to be the fully qualified location where cluster backup is stored (till cluster name). E.g. bucket_name/test_backup/test/us-east-1/cass_appname . Default: None priam.restore.snapshot : This is the start dateTime and end dateTime from which cluster will be restored. Priam will start finding the latest full snapshot from the end dateTime and will keep going till start dateTime. After the full snapshot is found, Priam downloads all the incremental's. E.g. 2017040500,201704092359 . Default: None priam.restore.threads : The number of threads to use for restore. Default: 8 priam.restore.cf.include : Column Family(ies), comma delimited, to include for restore. If no override exists, all keyspaces/cf's will be restored. The expected format is keyspace.cfname. CF name allows special character \" * \" to denote all the columnfamilies in a given keyspace. e.g. keyspace1.* denotes all the CFs in keyspace1. Restore exclude list is applied first to exclude CF/keyspace and then restore include list is applied to include the CF's/keyspaces. Default: None priam.restore.cf.exclude : Column Family(ies), comma delimited, to ignore while doing restore. The expected format is keyspace.cfname. CF name allows special character \" * \" to denote all the columnfamilies in a given keyspace. e.g. keyspace1.* denotes all the CFs in keyspace1. Restore exclude list is applied first to exclude CF/keyspace and then restore include list is applied to include the CF's/keyspaces. Default: None priam.clrestore.max : Max number of commit logs to restore. This will by default take last N number of commit logs to restore if commit log backup is enabled. Default: 10 . priam.postrestorehook.enabled : indicates if postrestorehook is enabled. priam.postrestorehook : contains the command with arguments to be executed as part of postrestorehook. Priam would wait for completion of this hook before proceeding to starting C*. priam.postrestorehook.heartbeat.filename : heartbeat file that postrestorehook emits. Priam keeps a tab on this file to make sure postrestorehook is making progress. Otherwise, a new process of postrestorehook would be spawned (upon killing existing process if still exists) priam.postrestorehook.done.filename :'done' file that postrestorehook creates upon completion of execution. priam.postrestorehook.timeout.in.days :maximum time that Priam should wait before killing the postrestorehook process (if not already complete) priam.download.queue.size : Queue size to be used for restore downloads. Note that once queue is full, we would wait for priam.download.timeout to add any new item before declining the request and throwing exception. Default: 100,000. priam.download.timeout : Downloads are scheduled in priam.download.queue.size . If queue is full then we wait for this time for the queue to have an entry available for queueing the current task. Default: 10 minutes. Support for Encrypted Backups Priam restore will handle decryption of the encrypted files. Any file downloaded from remote file system will be first decrypted and then decompressed to ephemeral disk. As part of the restore, Priam will decrypt the ciphertext to plaintext if property ( priam.encrypted.restore.enabled ) is set to true. Priam uses PGP as the encryption / decryption cryptography algorithm. Other algorithm can be implemented via interface IFileCryptography. *Note: Pgp uses a passphrase to encrypt your private key on your node. See (http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/), section \u201cwhat is a passphrase\u201d for details. Priam restore from AWS bucket using \u201crole assumption\u201d: The use case is you are trying to restore objects created by different AWS accounts. See AWS documentation for \u201ccross account access using roles\u201d for detail information. Currently, Google cloud and secondary/cross AWS accounts are supported for restoring the encrypted backups. Configuration priam.encrypted.restore.enabled : Enable the restore where the backups are encrypted using PGP. priam.pgp.password.phrase : The passphrase used by the cryptography algorithm to encrypt/decrypt. By default, it is expected that this value will be encrypted using open encrypt. Default: None . priam.private.key.location : The location on disk of the private key used by the cryptography algorithm. priam.pgp.pubkey.file.location : The location on disk of the public key used by the cryptography algorithm. priam.restore.source.type : The type of source for the restore. Valid values: AWSCROSSACCT or GOOGLE. Default: None priam.gcs.service.acct.id : Google Cloud Storage service account id. This value is supposed to be encrypted using open encrypt. Default: None priam.gcs.service.acct.private.key : The absolute path on disk for the Google Cloud Storage PFX file (i.e. the combined format of the private key and certificate). This value is supposed to be encrypted using open encrypt. Default: None priam.roleassumption.arn : Amazon Resource Name to assume while restoring the backups from an AWS account which requires cross-account assumption. Default: None API Restore Status http://localhost:8080/Priam/REST/v1/restore/status This gives the status of the current or last restore.
